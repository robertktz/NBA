    "# Model Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "In the \"04_model_deployment\" notebook, the focus is on deploying the trained model to be used in production or for making predictions on new data. Here's a guide to the typical steps involved after model training and evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Save the Trained Model: After training and evaluating the model, it's important to save it for future use. This can be done using the serialization capabilities of the chosen machine learning library, such as pickle in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Load the Trained Model: In the deployment notebook, you'll start by loading the saved trained model. This step ensures that you have access to the model object and its associated parameters for making predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Preprocess New Data: If you plan to use the model for making predictions on new data, you'll need to preprocess the new data in a similar manner as you did during the training phase. This may involve steps like handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, or scaling/normalizing numerical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Make Predictions: With the loaded model and preprocessed new data, you can use the model's predict function to generate predictions. This step allows you to apply the trained model to new data instances and obtain the predicted output.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Evaluate Model Performance: After making predictions, you can evaluate the model's performance on the new data. This step helps you assess how well the model generalizes to unseen instances and whether any adjustments or improvements are necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Deploy the Model: Once you're satisfied with the model's performance, you can deploy it in a production environment. This can involve integrating the model into a web application, creating an API endpoint, or deploying it as a standalone service.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Monitor and Update: Once the model is deployed, it's important to continuously monitor its performance and assess its accuracy over time. If needed, you can update the model periodically to incorporate new data or improve its performance based on feedback and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the specific steps and implementation details may vary depending on the deployment environment, framework, and requirements of your project."
